	AniList is a service used for researching, rating, and keeping lists of anime and manga. In addition to their website there is a AniList API that allows for interaction with
	their databases. They have put out pretty helpful <a href="http://anilist-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">documentation</a> which is a great reference to see
	what the API is capable of but lacks specific implementation details. This How-To will cover javascript implementation of AniList Authentication, anime searching and anime
	reviewing. There are more capabilities to the API but these areas give all the basic implementation details necessary and anything else can easily be constructed using
	this How-To and the information in the documentation.<p>
	This How-To will using Javascript so if the language of a code snippet is not stated it can safely be assumed to be Javascript.<p>
	All API URLs will begin with https://anilist.co/api/ so when discussing them that section is left off (i.e. https://anilist.co/api/anime/reviews would be referred to as
	/anime/reviews).
